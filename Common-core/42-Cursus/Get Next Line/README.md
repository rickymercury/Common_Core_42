üó£Ô∏è Introduction: Project Overview <a id="intro"></a> </h3>

This repository hosts the implementation of the **Get Next Line** project, a key milestone in our journey through the 42 curriculum.

The **Get Next Line** project challenges us to create/implement a custom C function capable of reading a file line by line efficiently and returning the next line from a file descriptor, no matter the file's size, content or complexity, handling edge cases such as varying buffer sizes, multiple file descriptors, and incomplete lines, all while ensuring proper memory management.

It provides us an opportunity to explore how file reading can be implemented in a controlled, efficient manner, highlighting important concepts like dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and handling edge cases.

The main challenge lies in ensuring the function performs seamlessly across different scenarios from handling both large and small files while managing memory efficienttly, fragmented inputs, all while preventing memory leaks or overflows, ensuring stable performance. 

We don‚Äôt just learn how to read files, we gain insights into designing scalable algorithms and crafting maintainable, reusable code while addressing practical challenges faced in real-world programming scenarios.

    What is Get Next Line? 
</h3>

>
> **Get Next Line** is a custom C function designed to read a file  and return the next line from a file descriptor, offering a robust solution for line-by-line file processing.  
Built entirely from scratch, it emphasizes **dynamic memory allocation**, **buffered input/output**, and efficient handling of edge cases, such as files with no newline characters, extremely large lines, or invalid file descriptors.

Through its implementation, **Get Next Line** introduces key programming concepts like managing static variables for state preservation, optimizing memory usage, and handling simultaneous access to multiple file descriptors. The project challenges students to work with system calls like `read`, effectively interact with file descriptors, and ensure scalability and reliability in constrained environments.

By mastering this function, programmers develop foundational skills in writing efficient, adaptable code for real-world scenarios, making **Get Next Line** an essential tool for future projects that require precise text processing.



In this project we must create a function that returns one line from the specified fd every time it is called, followed by a newline if the line has one. This project introduces the idea of static variables, which will be very useful for future projects. On top of that, we'll also learn a way to define macros right when compiling!













> **Get Next Line** focuses on creating a function capable of reading and returning a line from a file descriptor.  
This function is designed to handle **dynamic memory allocation** efficiently while accommodating input from various sources, such as files, standard input, etc.


    
It uses buffered input to optimize file reading, reducing the number of I/O operations by storing chunks of data in memory.
The function must also handle dynamic inputs and edge cases, such as files with no newline characters or lines exceeding the buffer size.

    
    Get Next Line is a custom C function designed to read and return a single line at time from a file descriptor, regardless of the file's size, content, or complexity.

    This function optimizes file reading by leveraging buffered input, minimizing the number of I/O operations by storing chunks of data in memory. It is built to handle dynamic and challenging scenarios, including files without newline characters, lines that exceed the buffer size, and simultaneous access to multiple file descriptors.

    Through its implementation, Get Next Line highlights essential programming concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, efficient buffer management, and the ability to address real-world edge cases, making it a powerful and flexible solution for line-by-line file processing in C.

Unlike traditional C functions such as fgets or getline, which abstract much of the complexity, Get Next Line is implemented entirely from scratch, challenging us to manually handle fundamental programming concepts such as:

    Buffered Input/Output: Optimizing file reading by processing data in predefined chunks (buffers), reducing the overhead of frequent I/O operations.

    Dynamic Memory Management: Allocating and freeing memory effectively to handle lines of varying length.

    State Preservation: Managing static variables or external data structures ensuring that data is retained between multiple calls, maintaining the continuity in file reading.

    Robust Edge Case Handling: Managing edge cases such as invalid file descriptors, like empty files, memory failures, extremely large lines, non-standard input (unexpected input), or interrupted system calls.

The project goes beyond merely reading files ‚Äî it introduces us to practical problem-solving in C, where efficiency and adaptability are paramount. Through this challenge, we :

    Understand how file descriptors work, leveraging system calls like read to interact directly with the operating system.

    Learn to manage computational resources effectively to ensure our function scales with large inputs and remains fast under constrained environments.

    Write a reusable function that integrates seamlessly into any future project or application requiring text processing. 





<h3 align="center" style="font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #2C3E50;"> üéØ Main Goals </h3>

The Get Next Line project has two primary objectives:

<h3 align="center" style="font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #2C3E50;"> 
    Mastering File I/O in C 
</h3>

The project provides hands-on experience with low-level file handling in C.
By implementing a function that interacts directly with file descriptors, we explore concepts like buffered reading, managing end-of-file conditions, and handling potential errors during I/O operations.

This understanding is critical for developing efficient applications that process large amounts of data.

<h3 align="center" style="font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #2C3E50;"> 
    Building a Flexible and Efficient Tool 
</h3>

The function we develop is designed to be generic and reusable.
It should handle any file descriptor (standard input, files, pipes, etc.) and work efficiently with arbitrarily large files.
The ability to allocate memory dynamically ensures that the function remains robust, even in edge cases like extremely long lines or sparse files.

    Importance for Future Projects 
</h3>

The Get Next Line project lays a strong foundation for working with dynamic memory management and buffered I/O, skills that are indispensable in later 42 projects.
For example:

    Handling file inputs in a custom shell.
    Parsing data for more complex applications like databases or web servers.

By mastering Get Next Line, we gain the confidence to tackle real-world file handling challenges and design efficient systems capable of processing large-scale data streams.

   üåü Why Get Next Line? 
</h3>

Get Next Line is not just about reading a file; it‚Äôs about building a robust, efficient algorithm that seamlessly integrates buffering, error handling, and dynamic allocation.
It challenges us to write clean, modular code that can adapt to diverse contexts, preparing us for larger-scale programming tasks.

This project reinforces our understanding of system-level programming and provides a practical introduction to state management and low-level I/O operations, all while adhering to strict performance and reliability standards.
