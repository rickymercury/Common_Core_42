## 🗣️ **Project Overview** <a id="introduction"></a>

This repository hosts a custom C library known as **<span style="color:blue">Libft</span>**, which was implemented as part of a coding project. The primary objective of this project is to develop a **static library** (`.a` file) by reimplementing a variety of standard C library functions, as well as adding a few additional, useful functions that enhance the functionality of the C programming language.

> **What is a Static Library?**
> 
> A **static library** is essentially a collection of precompiled **object files** (`.o` files) bundled together. These object files are linked directly into the final executable during the compilation process, meaning the functions from the static library become part of the executable itself. This process contrasts with **dynamic libraries**, which are linked at runtime.

## ✨ **Project Goals**

The main goal of this project is:

1. **Understanding Standard Library Functions**  
   This project provides a deeper understanding of how commonly used standard library functions are implemented at a lower level. By manually implementing these functions, the programmer gains insight into how things like **memory management**, **string manipulation**, and other core operations work under the hood.
   
2. **Reusable Tool for C Projects**  
   The library serves as a versatile tool that can be reused across various C projects, eliminating the need for relying on external dependencies or standard library functions in certain contexts.

- [ft_memcmp](https://github.com/rickymercury/Common_Core_42/tree/main/Common-core/42-Cursus/Libft/srcs/Study/memory/ft_memcmp): Compares two memory blocks byte-by-byte, up to a specified number of bytes, to determine their equality.
- [ft_calloc](https://github.com/rickymercury/Common_Core_42/tree/main/Common-core/42-Cursus/Libft/srcs/Study/memory/ft_calloc): Allocates memory for an array of a specified number of elements, initializing the memory to zero. Is particularly important as it not only allocates memory but also initializes it to zero, which is useful for preventing the use of uninitialized memory.


These functions are all designed to operate on raw memory and are often used for operations where the content or structure of the memory is not as important as the underlying bytes themselves. They allow for efficient memory manipulation, which is necessary for tasks like buffer handling and memory clearing.

Together, these memory functions cover common memory manipulation tasks while ensuring safety and efficiency, particularly when dealing with raw memory operations, allocation, and initialization.


### Utility Functions <a id="utility"></a>

The **Utility functions** category encompasses a variety of functions that perform operations on characters, strings, and data conversions. These functions are essential for handling common tasks related to character classification, manipulation, and input/output operations.
